## Foundational workflow for an open-source GPU

The Borg (Bring your Own Graphics) project aims to establish the complete foundational workflow
for an open-source GPU using entirely free and open Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools.
Recognizing that full GPU development is highly complex, the initiative capitalizes on recent
advances in low-cost chip manufacturing to make individual tape-outs feasible for small teams.
The initial, focused objective is to successfully design, verify, and manufacture a tiny
floating-point unit (FPU)—the central component of modern graphics processors—by validating
every step of the pipeline, from high-level design and FPGA prototyping to the final
RTL-to-GDS-flow. This strategic focus proves the viability of an open-source manufacturing and
development pathway for future graphics hardware.
