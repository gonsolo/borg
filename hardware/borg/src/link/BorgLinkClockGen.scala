/** Beat-rate generator and link training.
  *
  * == Rate ==
  *
  * The ASIC core clock '''is''' the ULX3S `sysClock`, 25 MHz, so the two chips form
  * one synchronous system offset only by a fixed board delay (mesochronous).  Beat
  * rate is decoupled from core rate by a clock *enable* at ÷N: the core computes at
  * full 25 MHz while the pins move at a rate the off-chip path can actually meet.
  *
  * N=2 (12.5 MHz) at reset, because the hand-computed pad budget closes there with
  * ~24 ns of margin against ~14.6/16 ns of path, whereas N=1 leaves only ~4-5 ns --
  * too thin to bet a one-shot tapeout on.  The `link_fast` strap selects N=1 as a
  * post-silicon lever.  Safe mode is the default, so a mis-strapped board degrades
  * rather than bricking.
  *
  * == Training: find the transitions, not the beats ==
  *
  * [[LinkTx]] registers its pins on `beatEn`, so they are '''stable for the whole
  * beat period'''.  Both sides run at the same period, so the slave samples each
  * distinct pin value exactly once whatever its phase -- logical correctness does
  * not actually depend on alignment.  What alignment buys is '''timing margin''':
  * with N=2 one phase samples immediately after the pins change and the other
  * samples ~40 ns later, in the middle of the eye.  Only the second is safe.
  *
  * So training cannot work by hunting for valid beats (a sparse `v` pattern would
  * not survive the registered path, and a steady one carries no phase information).
  * Instead the master drives a pattern that '''inverts every beat''', the slave
  * oversamples at the core rate and detects where the data changes, and then places
  * its beat `N/2` cycles after that transition -- as far into the eye as the divider
  * resolution allows.
  *
  * After `trainBeats` consecutive transitions at the expected phase the slave raises
  * `link_up`, which the master reads back on a pin before sending real traffic.  At
  * N=1 there is only one phase and training degenerates to a no-op.
  *
  * Framing and parity would eventually catch a gross misalignment, but that makes
  * bring-up a lottery and would leave a marginal-but-working phase undetected. This
  * makes it deterministic, and testable in simulation from a deliberately wrong phase.
  *
  * '''Note''' the training pattern keeps `v` asserted, so a slave-side [[LinkRx]]
  * will happily decode garbage packets during training.  Consumers must ignore
  * received traffic while `link_up` is low.
  *
  * @param isMaster true for the FPGA side (defines the phase), false for the ASIC
  *                 side (recovers it).
