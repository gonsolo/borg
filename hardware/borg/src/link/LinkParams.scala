/** TileLink TL-UL opcode encodings, reused verbatim on the wire.
  *
  * Nothing here depends on rocket-chip -- these are just the numbers, copied so
  * that a future thin adapter into a Chipyard/Rocket system does not have to
  * translate.  TL-UL and TL-UH are wire-identical (A+D only, `hasBCE=false`);
  * only TL-C adds the B/C/E channels, which this link does not carry.
  *
  * A- and D-channel opcode spaces overlap by design in TileLink (`PutFullData`
  * and `AccessAck` are both 0).  They never collide here because each physical
  * direction carries exactly one A-type and one D-type channel, and the header's
  * `chan` bit says which:
  *
  *   - DN (FPGA→ASIC): chan M is A-type (MMIO request), chan V is D-type (VRAM response)
  *   - UP (ASIC→FPGA): chan V is A-type (VRAM request),  chan M is D-type (MMIO response)

  * @param w            Data lanes per direction on the pins.  16 fills the 46-pad
  *                     budget exactly; 8 is the `link_narrow` post-silicon recovery
  *                     mode, which halves the pins and doubles `beatsPerFlit`.
  *                     The 16-bit flit format is unchanged either way.
  * @param narrowCapable Build the *runtime* w=16 -> w=8 mux, driven by the
  *                     `link_narrow` strap, rather than fixing the width at
  *                     elaboration.  This is what makes narrow mode a real
  *                     recovery path: ASIC pins cannot be re-synthesized after
  *                     tapeout, so a Scala-time `w = 8` is only a different
  *                     build, not something silicon can be talked into.  The
  *                     lanes stay physically 16 wide; narrow drives d[7:0] and
  *                     ties d[15:8] low, takes two beats per flit (LSB slice
  *                     first, matching the elaboration-time split), and
  *                     computes parity over the ACTIVE lanes only -- covering
  *                     the tied-off half would make a stuck-high unused lane
  *                     indistinguishable from real data.
  * @param creditDepth  Outstanding A-channel packets permitted per direction.  This
  *                     '''must not exceed what the receiver can buffer'''.  Both
  *                     adapters are single-outstanding by construction -- `HuttBus`
  *                     is a single-outstanding req/resp bus and Borg holds `gpuMem`
  *                     asserted until `ready` -- and they hold exactly one request,
  *                     so 1 is the correct value.  Raising it without adding a
  *                     receive queue would let a second packet arrive mid-service
  *                     and be dropped.  It costs nothing here: the sender is
  *                     waiting on the response anyway.
  * @param maxBurstLog2 Largest gpuMem burst the link will carry, as a power of two.
  *                     4 → 16 words, which is what BorgTileFlusher emits.  Bursts are
  *                     encoded log2 so the packet length stays a pure function of the
  *                     header (see [[LinkFlit.flitsUp]]).
  * @param divLog2      Beat-rate divider at reset, as a power of two.  1 → ÷2, i.e.
  *                     12.5 MHz beats from the 25 MHz core clock, which is what the
  *                     hand-computed pad budget closes at with ~24 ns of margin.
  *                     The `link_fast` strap selects 0 (÷1, 25 MHz) post-silicon.
  * @param gapBeats     Idle beats forced between packets.  Must be ≥1: it is what
  *                     makes the receiver self-resynchronizing after a framing error.
  * @param trainBeats   Consecutive good training beats required before `link_up`.
