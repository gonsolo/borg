/** Build-time configuration for the Borg GPU.
  *
  * Encapsulates all target-specific knobs so that a single parameter
  * flows through the entire hierarchy.
  *
  * @param fp           Floating-point format (FP16 for iCE40, FP32 for future ASIC)
  * @param coordWidth   Pixel coordinate width: max framebuffer dimension = 2^coordWidth.
  *                     6 → 64px (FPGA), 9 → 512px (ASIC/sim for 500×500 renders)
  * @param fifoDepth    Command FIFO depth.
  * @param maxBinTiles     Maximum number of tiles tracked by BorgBinner's on-chip
  *                        count SRAM.  Each entry costs 10 bits of flip-flops:
  *                        1024 entries ≈ 920 kµm² (50 % of the IHP 8×4 tile!).
  *                        ULX3S/sim uses 1024 (covers 800×480 @ 4×4 tiles = 24000 →
  *                        capped; real TBR over 1024 tiles only).
  *                        ASIC uses 16 to fit the IHP 8×4 die (16-tile render grid).
  * @param maxInstructions Shader instruction memory depth.  Each entry is 32 bits.
  *                        56 entries ≈ 145 kµm²; 32 entries ≈ 83 kµm² (saves 62 kµm²).
  *                        The rasterizer edge-test shader is a separate, permanent
  *                        ROM (BorgRasterRom) and does not consume this budget --
  *                        this is purely the fragment-shader (and, time-multiplexed,
  *                        vertex-shader) writable IMEM. ASIC uses 64, sized to fit
  *                        cube.frag's 59 words.
  * @param maxUniforms  Uniform memory depth.  64 = two 32-entry pages (double-buffered
  *                     for CPU/GPU overlap); 32 = single page (saves ~25 kµm² on ASIC
  *                     where the sequencer always writes page 0).
  * @param hasPerfCounters Wire up the 5×32-bit GPU performance counters (total/frag/
  *                     flush/stall/dma).  Useful for fps profiling on ULX3S; omitted
  *                     on ASIC to save ~18 kµm².
  * @param fragLanes  Fragment-shader SIMT width.  1 = scalar (one pixel per shader pass,
  *                     the current behaviour); 4 = a 2×2 pixel quad per pass (4× shader
  *                     throughput, lays the architecture for dFdx/dFdy).  ULX3S/sim use 4;
  *                     ASIC stays at 1 (area).
  * @param samples  Multisample (MSAA) rate: colour+depth samples stored per pixel in
  *                 the tile buffer.  1 = single-sample (historical behaviour, the
  *                 bit-exact regression anchor); 4 = 4× MSAA, required by Vulkan's
  *                 `framebufferColorSampleCounts` minimum limit.  One fragment shade
  *                 per pixel is broadcast to every covered sample (standard MSAA, NOT
  *                 `sampleRateShading`, which Vulkan permits reporting unsupported).
  *                 Costs `(samples-1) * 64` bits per tile entry; the resolve (average)
  *                 happens in BorgTileFlusher so the DRAM burst format is unchanged.
  * @param maxTrianglesPerTile Upper bound on BorgSequencer/BorgBinner's `binRowBytes`
  *                     MMIO input (= this * 2 bytes/entry), used to narrow the
  *                     tile-index*binRowBytes multiplier's width instead of leaving
  *                     it at the register's full 20 bits. MUST match (or exceed)
  *                     software/borg/borg_layout.h's SEQ_MAX_TRI -- that's a single
  *                     compile-time constant shared unconditionally by every target
  *                     (borg_driver.c's only write site: `seq_bin_row_bytes =
  *                     TBR_BIN_ROW_BYTES = SEQ_MAX_TRI*2`), so 256 here is safe for
  *                     both Default/Simt and Asic without any firmware coordination.
  *                     If SEQ_MAX_TRI ever grows, this must grow with it.
