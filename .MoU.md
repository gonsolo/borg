# Borg - European Graphics Processing Unit

The Borg (Bring your Own Graphics) project aims to establish the complete foundational workflow for an open-source GPU using entirely free and open Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools.  Recognizing that full GPU development is highly complex, the initiative capitalizes on recent advances in low-cost chip manufacturing to make individual tape-outs feasible for small teams.  The initial, focused objective is to successfully design, verify, and manufacture a tiny floating-point unit (FPU)—the central component of modern graphics processors—by validating every step of the pipeline, from high-level design and FPGA prototyping to the final RTL-to-GDS-flow. This strategic focus proves the viability of an open-source manufacturing and development pathway for future graphics hardware.

## {1000} Basic FPU on software simulator

The heart of a GPU is a shader processor that processes different kinds of instructions, computational, data access and flow control. Start with the simplest and most common ones: floating-point arithmetic.

- {500} Get floating-point multiplication and addition running on a simulator.

- {500} Add cocotb tests for the FPU unit and integrate it into TinyQV, a small RISC-V processor written for Tinytapeout.

## {1000} Basic FPU on FPGA

Get the FPU running on a FPGA. This way it can be tested under a full Linux environment.

- {500} Adapt TinyQV's fpga environment to include the FPU.

- {500} Write some small compiler or adapt an existing one to compile a small shader to the instruction set supported by the FPU. At this point it hasn't been decided which compiler to use, if any, candidates are LLVM or the Mesa compiler.

## {1000} Vulkan test suite

- {500} Select one of the the Vulkan compute tests from the official test suite.
  Adapt the Mesa driver to compile it. Write tests to simulate it.

- {500} Run the Vulkan compute test on the FPGA.

## {1000} Rinse and repeat

- {500} The full Vulkan Conformance Test Suite (CTS) consists of millions of tests. Expand the number of tests of the Vulkan Compute subsuite that are run successfully.

- {500} Maybe tasks outside of Vulkan Compute can be added like vertex shaders.

## {1000} Send to Tinytapeout.com to get silicon

- {500} On March 23th 2026, the TTIHP26a shuttle for TinyTapeout is scheduled. Submit it.

- {500} On September 9th 2026, the chips are expected. Receive them and test them.
